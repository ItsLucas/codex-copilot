# codex-copilot

Points an installed **OpenAI Codex CLI** at the **GitHub Copilot CAPI** over the
stateful `ws:/responses` transport, with native remote compaction v2, and
recalibrates the bundled model catalog so every model on your seat budgets
against its own real CAPI context window.

It is deliberately **not a proxy**. Nothing sits between Codex and CAPI at
runtime: Codex opens the WebSocket to `api.*.githubcopilot.com` itself, sends
the bearer itself, and keeps the connection-bound state (`previous_response_id`,
incremental input, server-side compaction) that a relay would have to replay or
break. What this tool does is one-shot: it computes the configuration that makes
the native path work and writes it down. After that it is out of the loop, and
`codex` runs with no extra process, port, or certificate.

It writes one overlay file plus one directory under `$CODEX_HOME`. Your
`config.toml` is never touched, and nothing is active until you pass
`--profile copilot`.

The bearer is your GitHub OAuth token, read at request time from the
`COPILOT_GITHUB_TOKEN` environment variable. **This tool never stores it** - no
keyring, no registry write, no file. `login` prints the token and the one-liner
that sets the variable; you run it.

## Prerequisites

- `codex` on PATH (`npm install -g @openai/codex`), or `--codex-bin <path>`.
  On Windows the npm entry point is a `codex.cmd` / `codex.ps1` shim rather than
  an `.exe`; it is resolved and launched correctly without help.
- A GitHub Copilot seat on which the target model is enabled: CAPI `GET /models`
  must list it with `policy.state == enabled` and `ws:/responses` among its
  `supported_endpoints`. `install` warns (with the remedy) rather than aborting
  if it is not, so the rest of the setup still lands.
- Build from source: Rust 1.88+, `cargo build --release`.

## Install

```console
$ codex-copilot login

  Open       https://github.com/login/device
  Enter code A1B2-C3D4
  Scope      read:user   (app Ov23ctDVkRmgkPke0Mmm)
  Waiting for approval; Ctrl-C aborts.
  Approved.

GitHub token (GitHub device flow), shown once:

    COPILOT_GITHUB_TOKEN=gho_xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx

Nothing on disk holds it. Set it as a user environment variable yourself:

    PowerShell   [Environment]::SetEnvironmentVariable("COPILOT_GITHUB_TOKEN", "gho_xxx", "User")
    bash         echo 'export COPILOT_GITHUB_TOKEN=gho_xxx' >> ~/.profile
    zsh          echo 'export COPILOT_GITHUB_TOKEN=gho_xxx' >> ~/.zshrc
```

Set the variable, open a new shell, then:

```console
$ codex-copilot install          # or: codex-copilot install --token gho_xxx
```

`install` reads the token from `--token`, `--token-stdin`, or
`COPILOT_GITHUB_TOKEN`; with none of the three it runs the device flow inline,
exactly as `login` does. Then it probes for your gateway
(`api.enterprise` -> `api.business` -> `api.individual` -> `api.githubcopilot.com`,
first `GET /models` that answers 200 wins), downloads the `models.json` bundled
with your `codex --version`, calibrates it, and writes the profile. Add
`--dry-run` to see all of it without writing anything.

## What it writes

| Path | What |
| --- | --- |
| `$CODEX_HOME/copilot.config.toml` | the overlay Codex layers on `config.toml` when `--profile copilot` is passed |
| `$CODEX_HOME/copilot_config_toml/models-catalog.json` | the calibrated catalog (`model_catalog_json`) |
| `$CODEX_HOME/copilot_config_toml/state.json` | host, model, codex version, calibration table, timestamp - no secrets |

Nothing else on the machine changes: not `config.toml`, not the credential
store, not your environment variables.

## Usage

```console
$ codex --profile copilot
$ codex --profile copilot exec "..."
$ codex --profile copilot resume --last      # resume with the same profile
```

Plain `codex` keeps using your untouched base config. Sessions started under the
profile must be resumed under it too, or they fall back to your default
provider.

`codex-copilot status` re-checks the whole chain (token present, codex version
vs catalog version, `GET /models`, the model's policy and `ws:/responses`,
overlay and catalog parse). `codex doctor` is not profile-aware, so the real
end-to-end check is to start `codex --profile copilot` and send one short
message.

## Approval review

When run in a terminal, `codex-copilot install` (or bare `codex-copilot`) asks
whether to configure automatic approval review. Answer yes to select a reviewer
by number from the available model list. Only enabled CAPI models supporting
WebSocket Responses and compatible with the Codex catalog are offered.
Model selection requires an explicit number, even when only one model is
available. No reviewer is recommended or selected by default. Blank or invalid
answers are retried, and closing input cancels setup before files are written.

Answering no (the default) leaves `approvals_reviewer` out of the overlay,
so Codex inherits its reviewer setting from the base configuration. The
installer never forces manual review. Use `--skip-auto-review` to skip the
question explicitly. Non-interactive runs and `--token-stdin` also skip the
question; scripts can select a reviewer directly with:

```console
$ codex-copilot install --auto-review-model <model-id>
$ codex --profile copilot
```

The installer sets `approvals_reviewer = "auto_review"` and writes
`"auto_review_model_override": "<model-id>"` into each CAPI-served model's
catalog entry, so switching conversation models keeps the selected reviewer.
Codex then sends the real reviewer model ID directly to CAPI. This uses
[Codex's native model selection](https://github.com/openai/codex/blob/rust-v0.153.4/codex-rs/core/src/guardian/review.rs#L872),
with no alias or proxy. Model slugs, Guardian policy messages, approval policy,
and sandbox settings are preserved. Codex still handles denials, invalid
responses, and review timeouts.

Installation fails before writing if the reviewer is missing from CAPI or the
catalog, disabled, or lacks `ws:/responses`. The served catalog entries must
already define `auto_review_model_override`; otherwise update Codex and use
its matching bundled catalog. `status` checks both the saved review mapping
and the review model's availability. Reviewer inference consumes additional
CAPI usage.

Without an override, Codex can select the bundled `codex-auto-review` model,
which was absent from this seat's CAPI model listing. Local logs showed a
successful WebSocket connection followed by an unhandled `error` event and
an automatic-review timeout.

Reinstall and decline automatic approval setup (or use `--skip-auto-review`)
to remove the generated reviewer override and restore inheritance. This does
not disable automatic review if it is enabled in the base configuration.

Restart or resume with the profile after changing it; an already running
session can retain its previous reviewer selection. To request automatic
review when the base approval policy does not do so, Codex's `--approve-for-me`
option also selects the workspace-write sandbox.

## Per-model calibration

Codex resolves a model's window from its **catalog entry**, and the global
`model_context_window` key is clamped to that entry's `max_context_window` -
so raising the window means rewriting the entry. That is what calibration does,
per model, from this seat's own `GET /models`:

```
  model                    window    compact   capi max  base tier  ws   policy
  gpt-6-astra              872000     784800     872000     272000  yes  enabled  (2x tier)
  gpt-5.6-sol              922000     829800     922000     272000  yes  enabled  (2x tier)
  gpt-5.5                  922000     829800     922000     272000  yes  enabled  (2x tier)
  gpt-5.4                  922000     829800     922000     272000  yes  enabled  (2x tier)
  gpt-5.4-mini             272000     244800     272000     272000  yes  enabled
```

- `window` = CAPI's `long_context` tier ceiling, else the default tier, else
  `capabilities.limits.max_prompt_tokens`. `--context-window base` budgets
  against the standard-price tier instead; `--context-window <N>` clamps to a
  count you choose.
- `compact` = `floor(0.9 x window)`. The ratio is fixed at 0.9 because that is
  exactly Codex's own auto-compaction ceiling (it clamps anything higher);
  the hard cap on what is offered to inference is 95%
  (`effective_context_window_percent`).
- `--model-window <slug>=<window>[:<compact>]` overrides one model. A window
  above what CAPI accepts is refused rather than written.
- Models in the bundled catalog that this seat does not serve are left exactly
  as Codex shipped them.

A local `model_catalog_json` has a second effect: Codex then stops polling
`/models` itself, whose CAPI-shaped answer it cannot parse (one error log every
~4m30s otherwise).

If the download fails (offline, proxy), `install` fails with the raw URL - fetch
it by hand and pass `--catalog <path>`.

## Billing

- Prompts above a model's **base tier** (272k on the seat above) fall into
  CAPI's `long_context` price tier, roughly **2x** per token. `--context-window
  max` is what puts you there; `--context-window base` keeps every model in the
  standard tier.
- Codex's startup **prewarm is a real, billed request** (~14 AIU per session
  with the stock responses-lite catalog). It is also what warms the WebSocket
  the whole session then rides, so shortening
  `websocket_connect_timeout_ms` throws away a request you already paid for.
- `install` and `status` cost nothing: `GET /models` is not a billed endpoint.

## Security

- The token lives in one place: a **user environment variable you set**. This
  tool prints it once and forgets it; the overlay stores only the variable's
  name (`env_key = "COPILOT_GITHUB_TOKEN"`), so the value is read fresh from the
  environment at request time.
- The overlay sets
  `[shell_environment_policy] exclude = ["COPILOT_GITHUB_TOKEN"]`, which keeps
  the token out of every subprocess Codex spawns for a shell tool call.
  `ignore_default_excludes` defaults to `true` in Codex, so this list is the
  only filter in effect. Being an array, it **replaces** any `exclude` list in
  your base `config.toml` - merge yours in if you have one.
- Telemetry is forced off in the overlay (`[analytics]`, `[otel]`,
  `[feedback]`). This matters here: the provider is named `OpenAI`, so an
  enabled exporter would POST to an openai.com host while the process holds
  Copilot credentials.
- `state.json` holds no secrets, and `status` reports the token as a prefix and
  a length only.

## Rollback

```console
$ codex-copilot uninstall
```

Removes the overlay, the catalog and `state.json` (and the profile directory, if
empty), then prints the one-liner to clear `COPILOT_GITHUB_TOKEN` yourself. It
does not touch your environment. Deleting
`$CODEX_HOME/copilot.config.toml` by hand is equally valid: with the overlay
gone, `--profile copilot` is a silent no-op.

## Platform support

Verified on Windows 11. macOS and Linux are supported by the code (the same
paths, `~/.profile` for bash or `~/.zshrc` for zsh instead of the registry) but are
built and tested only in CI - the matrix runs `fmt`, `clippy -D warnings`,
`build --release` and the full test suite on `ubuntu-latest`, `macos-latest` and
`windows-latest`.

## Commands

| Command | Does |
| --- | --- |
| `login` | device flow, prints the token and the set-variable one-liner |
| `install` (default) | probes the host, calibrates the catalog, writes the overlay |
| `status` | summarises the install and checks every link |
| `uninstall` | removes what install wrote, prints the unset one-liner |

Global: `--profile <name>` (default `copilot`), `--codex-home <dir>`,
`--codex-bin <path>`, `--dry-run`.
